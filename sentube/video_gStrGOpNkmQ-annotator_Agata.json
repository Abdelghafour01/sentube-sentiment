If only they did the AWD in a decent powered deisel like Audi.","published":"2012-10-30T13:13:34.000Z","id":"Kr9-jlZ95lLmDNrPp2vH64AM42jT6vr1gR6iJj1iBvA","author":"Nick Clarke","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"3","video-related":"1","vrating":"2"}},{"text":"now that\ufeff saab is gone my next new ride will wear a volvo badge","published":"2012-10-31T01:15:53.000Z","id":"Kr9-jlZ95lLa6K8qnmThXwazDAeY4Lo_iKgr9Be2OU4","author":"Darren Vervaet","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"1"}},{"text":"Hell ya, Italians allways go first :) i rather take a 500 over this!!!\ufeff :D","published":"2012-11-04T11:37:01.000Z","id":"Kr9-jlZ95lJIRJmsQZltbfm2PjPtqcCW4QQytD9AmkA","author":"Christopher Sietses","annotation":{"product-related":"1","negative-product":"1","rating":"1"}},{"text":"The S60R is a fun car to drive--and without the\ufeff bloated price tag most German cars have.","published":"2012-11-06T12:42:07.000Z","id":"Kr9-jlZ95lK_z249z5C0BWXn3tzRa5AxVHuGcy74BDo","author":"outrigger777","annotation":{"product-related":"1","positive-product":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"Ye me\ufeff too :P","published":"2012-11-09T12:50:00.000Z","id":"Kr9-jlZ95lIFmQQ9EcrliZKOFfQIHm5p0965rsBbDAw","author":"ThoUnit","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"Some say that\ufeff he was born deaf, and that he owns a G-Wiz all we know he is the sound editor.","published":"2012-11-09T17:01:04.000Z","id":"Kr9-jlZ95lK31LZa90mLIMYYnv0begXUFKigHdyhqTo","author":"ivancomputer22","annotation":{"video-related":"1","vrating":"1","negative-video":"1"}},{"text":"6:00 Anyone else notice that this Swedish family car beat the Italian Stallion Ferrari 575 with the 5.7l V12 by 0.2 seconds?\ufeff \n\nTo me that's pretty good...","published":"2012-11-11T00:39:28.000Z","id":"Kr9-jlZ95lIf6jfwBtuxCNXSdGxJK8eThssaesQDKDs","author":"icelandicboy","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"2","positive-product":"1","video-related":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"Volvo's\ufeff sound system are awesome!
