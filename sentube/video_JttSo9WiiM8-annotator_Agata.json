Neither one is ultimately \"better\" under the premise of it being faster.","published":"2013-02-22T03:53:11.000Z","id":"9g0oILHoP43Re466LjJhRK4QuS0zZSWqquuOBs2LEiY","author":"PininfarinaSpA"},{"text":"I mean, if you would prefer the McLaren over the Ferrari, I would understand why you'd think that.

The idea daunts on you forever until you realize that there are great versions of both out there.","published":"2013-02-22T03:57:30.000Z","id":"9g0oILHoP438-v5BPQJzPo8rz0wckGWZ90q-J8j94pk","author":"PininfarinaSpA"},{"text":"I soooo want\ufeff the P1 to smoke the bugatti round a track haha can't wait !!!","published":"2013-02-24T18:57:45.000Z","id":"9g0oILHoP40J_BzVTs0iTB1iVWr04rXRv8gEi_XQTBo","author":"AKENOXTRM"},{"text":"McLaren\ufeff shits on the laws that govern air friction","published":"2013-03-08T20:11:51.000Z","id":"9g0oILHoP4108Zo3WfhGo9Kfrz5trq53CTqpvDNolTQ","author":"Tim Bob"}],"uploader":"McLarenAutomotiveTV","published":"2012-09-13T13:44:59.000Z","duration":"69"}
