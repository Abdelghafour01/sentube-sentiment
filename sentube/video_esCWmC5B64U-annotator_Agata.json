Gradually, the M-Class became a sales success in the United States and Mexico. In terms of size, it is slotted in between the smaller GLK-Class (based on the C-Class) and the larger GL-Class, with which it shares platforms. For a short time, between the years 1999 to 2002, the M class was also built by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, for the European market, until it moved to part of the U.S. market.\n\nThe newly redesigned M-class (chassis name W166) was introduced in pre-production form 10 June 2011 as a 2012 model. The first customer-designated W166 rolled off the Tuscaloosa production line on 20 July.[8] It is moderately refined, taking styling cues from the new generation Mercedes-Benz E-Class. An increase in rear seat legroom has been implemented, alongside adjustable rear back-rests. It is due to launch in September of 2011.\n\nNew features in the 2012 M-Class include an updated 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission to provide improved fuel economy, optional Adaptive Cruise Control (Distronic Plus), Active Lane Departure Warning System, and an adjustable-height air suspension (AirMatic).\n\nThe redesigned M-class (chassis name W164) was introduced in April 2005 as a 2006 model after a showing at the North American International Auto Show in January. It was almost entirely new, with a more sporting, aerodynamic look\u2014the coefficient of drag is down to 0.34. Mercedes-Benz has also made the new M-Class larger, measuring 150 mm longer than the first model. The M-Class was named \"Best New Sport Utility Vehicle\" in the 2006 Canadian Car of the Year awards.\n\nMercedes-Benz extensively publicized the US$600 million spent to update its factory and add manufacturing space for the new R-Class. According to early automotive press reports, the 2006 M-Class vehicles demonstrate vast improvements in quality.\n\nThe W164 platform used for the new M-Class is shared with the new GL-Class and is a unibody type rather than the former (W163) body-on-frame used by the M-Class vehicles produced from 1998--2005. The X164 GL-CLass, a longer seven-seater version of the W164 platform, is also available.\n\nNew features in the 2006 M-Class include the 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission, optional Active Curve-Illuminating Bi-Xenon headlights which \"steer\" in the path of the vehicle, and an adjustable-height air suspension. The manual transmission has been dropped. In most countries except US an Off-Road Pro package with locking on rear and center differential, low-range transmission and adjustable chassis clearance is available as an option.\n\n4-valve engines are replacing the previous 3-valve SOHC V6 and current 3-valve V8:\n\n    ML350 -- 3.5 L 4-valve V6, 366Hp(258 ft\u00b7lbf)\n    ML500 -- 5.0 L 3-valve V8, 302HP\n    ML500 (ML550 for North America) -- 5.5 L 4-valve V8, 382HP(550 N\u00b7m)\n    ML63 AMG -- 6.2 L 4-valve V8, 510HP (370 kW)\n    ML300 CDI -- 3.0 L V6 Turbo Diesel, 190.4HP (325 ft\u00b7lbf)\n    ML350 CDI -- 3.0 L V6 Turbo Diesel, 224HP (376 ft\u00b7lbf)\n    ML450 CDI -- 4.0 L V8 Diesel, 306HP (700 N\u00b7m)\n\nModels using Bluetec Diesel engine with urea injection were introduced in 2008 for the 2009 model year.\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mercedes_M_Class\n\n\ncarjamradio \"car jam radio\" \"car radio show\" \"car talk radio show\" \"carjam\" ferrari \"car talk\" \"bbc top gear\" \"great car ad 2011\" \"funny commercials 2011\" \"banned car commercials 2011\" f1 \"formula one\" \"funny videos\" \"classic cars\" evo \"best car ads 2011\" \"funny car ads 2011\" funniest \"fail\"  \"sexy car ad 2011\" \"road test\" \"road review\" \"car test\" \"road report\" \"driving test\" hot sexy new nissan fast Porsche suv \"celebrity car\" maserati vw audi 4x4 estate lotus fiat \"alfa romeo\" subaru toyota ford  impreza \"high speed\" \"tractor\" \"rally car\" crashes accidents","title":"Mercedes M Class Sexy Funny Commercial 2012 -  New Carjam TV Car Show 2013","avg_rating":"4.419355","video_id":"esCWmC5B64U","video_type":"commercial","comments":[{"text":"wow, now that is\ufeff a really ugly car","published":"2011-10-11T12:55:51.000Z","id":"XezP3wrgUHYxBIP6FajCFOX4fcXFPVlru4jy5qquUsk","author":"TheRoroki","annotation":{"product-related":"1","negative-product":"1","rating":"1"}},{"text":"bad commercial*  Too long \ufeff","published":"2011-10-18T20:35:03.000Z","id":"XezP3wrgUHaHRf_SDnn6aT3aOXBaC5V1eALD3BoTBGc","author":"piertrade","annotation":{"video-related":"1","negative-video":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"lol\ufeff this isn't a commercial....","published":"2011-10-31T22:44:43.000Z","id":"XezP3wrgUHZP6OMYanlDoNY3reijngdAkX5qs9pmAWs","author":"machinejet","annotation":{"video-related":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"I love my\ufeff mercedes.","published":"2011-12-06T04:43:57.000Z","id":"XezP3wrgUHZ2mZzKsxlQCOdcd2pN8Ns3sXKZLyas1aA","author":"thestig7423","annotation":{"product-related":"1","positive-product":"1","rating":"1"}},{"text":"it\ufeff is too boring and to long.","published":"2011-12-06T13:56:24.000Z","id":"XezP3wrgUHaCsfmt7oypHcbpbB6DoYFia-NbE6QWdZs","author":"louis1240","annotation":{"video-related":"1","negative-video":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"where the hell does his mom\ufeff live...............?","published":"2012-01-31T00:52:33.000Z","id":"XezP3wrgUHbxX8HJpIv5GNqT7TA1xgBeOzQlp1S_SLY","author":"toolatetoanswer","annotation":{"video-related":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"forget the\ufeff car...who's the guy?!","published":"2012-02-04T05:38:28.000Z","id":"XezP3wrgUHaY8uLFeawdeyLId2on5aVMu1VVhquGedM","author":"whereispip","annotation":{"video-related":"1","product-related":"1","negative-product":"1","positive-video":"1","rating":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"one phone call, and problem\ufeff solved","published":"2012-02-12T12:53:45.000Z","id":"XezP3wrgUHZwsJZK1mBFzNp9b6m0WEaF4h_0yNGCCsA","author":"stojko222","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"Too long\ufeff","published":"2012-02-19T18:30:29.000Z","id":"XezP3wrgUHZB7pQG3Q5Dlp5zq8bBOBFU_-phevv4R1U","author":"LatifaK9","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"is that an ad\ufeff or a movie?","published":"2012-02-24T00:21:16.000Z","id":"XezP3wrgUHalSaqB31fwmseXPZcTDDUe22QoqVKh5xg","author":"ravian1990ca","annotation":{"video-related":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"LOL !!!
