{"category":"Autos","view_count":"267473","video_description":"Full Review at: http:\/\/www.carbuyer.co.uk\/reviews\/volvo\/s60\/saloon\/review\n\nVolvo has long worked hard to be seen as a credible alternative to the big-selling premium German firms. And the S60 might just be the car to take on Audi, Mercedes-Benz and BMW - it feels like a very high quality product indeed. Despite Volvo's sporting aims, the S60 is a more comfortable drive than such rivals. That's a good thing, given the poor state of the UK's roads. The S60 was introduced with a range of powerful engines, while top-of-the-range models come with four-wheel drive. The economy-focused 1.6 diesel DRIVe version offers sub-115g\/km of CO2, meaning you'll only have to pay \u00a330 annually in Road Tax.\n\nDo you own this car?
