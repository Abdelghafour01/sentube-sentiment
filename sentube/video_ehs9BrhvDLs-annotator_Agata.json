Not only is it smartly styled, but it also offers impressive performance, practicality and value for money. Mazda's cars are renowned for being good to drive, and the 6 is no exception - it's equally happy being driven fast on a twisty B-road as it is on the school run. Mazda also has a strong record for reliability, and the current 6 has a better-built cabin than the previous model's.\n\nDo you own this car?
