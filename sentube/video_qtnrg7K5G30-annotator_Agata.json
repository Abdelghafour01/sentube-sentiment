There's even a good deal of space inside - enough for four adults at a push. However, it lacks the comfort and overall build quality to beat the Audi A1 and MINI for upmarket feel. Some of the cabin plastics are too hard and look cheap. The engine range offers great economy, though, which offsets the MiTo's relatively high purchase price. The MultiAir petrol engines impress with their performance and smoothness.\n\nGet six issues of our sister title, Auto Express magazine for \u00a31: http:\/\/subscribe.autoexpress.co.uk\/cb","title":"Alfa Romeo MiTo review - CarBuyer","avg_rating":"4.6873565","video_id":"qtnrg7K5G30","video_type":"review","comments":[{"text":"ALL\ufeff RIGHT","published":"2012-05-03T10:29:56.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-5IFTnTZC7huUmDktx7flfUvIaoSZ3_5YY","author":"KPNLFC","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"mike is just so much more fun\ufeff to watch","published":"2012-05-03T10:31:03.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-4eQs9eBLNK8arFUR5zCrlMgT9_EQ1ZXOg","author":"IBonedYourMom1234","annotation":{"video-related":"1","negative-video":"1","vrating":"2"}},{"text":"Third\ufeff","published":"2012-05-03T10:31:19.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-6-S1iP3WJ4qoMw7ER6oh7NkZlb-WUeOC8","author":"bakaenkaaka","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"FOURTH\ufeff","published":"2012-05-03T10:32:40.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-5BaLOXwjCR4kSckNgwUlV-HBYXB2yKnYo","author":"pimpninja1985","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"fourth\ufeff","published":"2012-05-03T10:32:48.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-4q9-nx5QManDQ7vlX5Bbv6hJOaiAHpoiY","author":"123Broodwar","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"300???\ufeff Geez...","published":"2012-05-03T10:33:09.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-4JyvABI4KayYuDMq7fR9G8hgUZGF2_8co","author":"Hugo Paredes","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"mike ?\ufeff lol","published":"2012-05-03T10:34:30.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-7N7WKPBmmbSPO1gLBUIFEf11ooGX64Fwg","author":"googleccd079","annotation":{"video-related":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"wtsup with her\ufeff and small cars?","published":"2012-05-03T10:35:02.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-77ECv8SeIWgULs5zDwNF0lo7M9C1PZi6c","author":"honeyisaac","annotation":{"video-related":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"More\ufeff alfa reviews please!","published":"2012-05-03T10:36:01.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-6Zqm3KWshoy7rSeN4KEnJBHe1_ylcguN4","author":"lhrmeonom","annotation":{"video-related":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"who the hell is mike?\ufeff","published":"2012-05-03T10:36:20.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-6Db16v9qE_HhXXWjTZEsfD8pq5pI3U4O4","author":"Xr08paradox","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"300 pounds contains a pack including usb-aux input, Bluetooth connectivity and\ufeff parking sensors","published":"2012-05-03T10:37:26.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-4pdTIIoLBOnUiL0NriMrXYhO8Ta3Gbyiw","author":"nickywii","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"why are\ufeff you always so late, in The Netherlands did they a review a year ago","published":"2012-05-03T10:38:44.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-6GRxT3R4FjcodZHwLW0TGeYZ-CEDc4CI8","author":"juriankriebel","annotation":{"video-related":"1","negative-video":"1","vrating":"2"}},{"text":"wow !! i just cannt resist myself !!\ufeff oh Rebekka","published":"2012-05-03T10:41:20.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-4tacibgP9Fp4MpaAbKt4p6e87Lc7p8dr8","author":"Gurjyot Nanda","annotation":{"video-related":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"alfa romeo has reliability issues, though\ufeff","published":"2012-05-03T10:41:34.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-4B-5i8bbKE4dd8TcrK1phfjdH5QJU80fs","author":"TheGreekJim","annotation":{"product-related":"1","positive-product":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"not any more\ufeff","published":"2012-05-03T10:43:08.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-5C9vWd0mIzybRzChgGDlNW5ptIf5B5Lws","author":"Michael Stergides","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"Rebecca, can you wear very\ufeff short skirts at your reviews? =)","published":"2012-05-03T10:44:01.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-4srDekZd41sQJvIdoe4ehOUsyRgzEW3V4","author":"GamerAndReviewer","annotation":{"video-related":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"dat  euro bias....\ufeff needs more negatives.","published":"2012-05-03T10:47:05.000Z","id":"ptck6WsZp-5vc8ngXW6dsE_n6tWEx-VkGYdg_6P5l_A","author":"KenniTheKid","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"Nice car, good review, SMILE\ufeff and emotions ...
