But the Citroen offers something different. It looks like a mix between an estate and a hatchback with a jacked-up ride height and boasts styling that's certain to turn heads. The interior is top-notch too with options like watch-strap leather sats and aircraft style switches that sit above the driver's head. It's a real step up in quality and style compared to Citroens of the past. Underneath the bonnet, the most important powertrain is the Hybrid4 which -- on some models claims tax-free CO2 emissions and impressive performance. A 1.6-litre diesel with 109bhp and a non-hybrid version of the 2.0 HDi also feature. The petrol options -- both 1.6s -- put out 153bhp and 197bhp.\n\nGet six issues of our sister title, Auto Express magazine for \u00a31: http:\/\/subscribe.autoexpress.co.uk\/cb","title":"Citroen DS5 review - CarBuyer","avg_rating":"4.8245163","video_id":"uoBmXZsqc1g","video_type":"review","comments":[{"text":"FIRST\ufeff !
