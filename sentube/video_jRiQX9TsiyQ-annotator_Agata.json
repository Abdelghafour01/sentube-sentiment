It was first introduced in 2005.\n\nThe Super Sport version of the Veyron is the fastest road-legal production car in the world, with a top speed of 431 km\/h (268 mph).[4] The original version has a top speed of 408.47 km\/h (253.81 mph).[5] It was named Car of the Decade (2000--2009) by the BBC television programme Top Gear.\n\nBased on the Bentley Hunaudi\u00e8res concept and built at Bugatti's HQ (Ch\u00e2teau Saint Jean in Molsheim, Alsace, France), the Veyron's chief designer was Hartmut Warkuss, and the exterior was designed by Jozef Kaba\u0148 of Volkswagen, with much of the engineering work being conducted under the guidance of engineering chief Wolfgang Schreiber. Though commissioned by Volkswagen, this car is only sold through the Bugatti manufacturers and cannot be found at any Volkswagen dealer.\nThe Veyron has received considerable praise from all three presenters of the popular BBC motoring show Top Gear. While initially skeptical that it would ever be produced, Jeremy Clarkson later declared the Veyron \"the greatest car ever made and the greatest car we will ever see in our lifetime.\" James May described the Veyron as \"our Concorde moment.\" Clarkson test drove the Veyron from Alba, northern Italy to London in a race against James May and Richard Hammond who made the journey in a Cessna 182 aeroplane.\n\nA few episodes later, James May drove the Veyron at the VW test track and took it to its top speed of 407.16 km\/h (253.00 mph). During the second episode of the 13th series, Richard Hammond raced the Veyron against the McLaren F1 driven by The Stig in a one mile (1.6 km) drag race in Abu Dhabi, commenting on Bugatti's \"amazing technical achievement\" versus the \"non gizmo\" racing purity of the F1. While the F1 was quicker off the line and remained ahead until both cars were travelling at approximately 200 km\/h, the Bugatti overtook its competitor from 200 to 300 km\/h, and emerged the victor. Hammond has stated that he did not use the Veyron's launch control in order to make the race more interesting.\n\nThe Veyron also won the award for Car of the Decade in Top Gear's end of 2010 award show. Clarkson commented \"It was a car that just rewrote the rule book really, an amazing piece of engineering, a genuine Concorde moment\". When the standard version was tested, it did not reach the top of the lap time leader board, which was speculated as being due to the car's considerable weight disadvantage against the other cars towards the top. The SuperSport version, however, achieved the fastest ever time of 1:16.8 (later beaten by the Ariel Atom V8, the McLaren MP4-12C and the Lamborghini Aventador[45]), as well as being taken to a (verified) average top speed of 431.072 km\/h (267.856 mph) by Raphanel on the programme,[46] thenceforth retaking its position as the fastest production car in the world.\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bugatti_Veyron\n\n\n\n\n\ncarjamradio \"car jam radio\" \"car radio show\" \"car talk radio show\" \"carjam\" ferrari \"car talk\" \"Car Radio Programme\" \"bbc top gear\" \"car tv programme\" \"car television show\" \"great car ad 2011\" \"funny commercials 2012\" \"Car Commercial 2012\" \"banned car commercials 2012\" \"funny commercials 2011\" \"Car Commercial 2011\" \"banned car commercials 2011\"f1 \"formula one\" \"funny videos\" \"classic cars\" evo \"best car ads 2011\" \"funny car ads 2011\" \"funniest fail\"  \"sexy car ad 2011\" \"road test\" \"road review\" \"car test\" \"road report\" \"driving test\" hot sexy new nissan fast Porsche suv \"celebrity car\" maserati vw audi 4x4 estate lotus fiat \"alfa romeo\" subaru toyota ford  impreza \"high speed\" \"tractor\" \"rally car\" crashes accidents","title":"New Bugatti Veyron 2012 In Detail 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse Commercial -
