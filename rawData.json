The allroad v8 in the liberal S4 spec produces about 340bhp/300lb-ft. I'm going to say a loaded truck and trailer is about 70,000lbs. There is no way that that little v8 could pull it up the hill that fast, if at all. I don't know alot about trucks, but I'll take an estimated guess and say that a truck like that has about 500bhp/1100lb-ft.",

And it should be noted that a man has been able to move an airliner as well, so seeing a V10 TDI with like 700lb-ft of torque pulling a slightly larger jet isn't altogether impressive. Furthermore I'm not talking about merely budging a trailer and truck.

Weird, don't you think?

OUCH!!!!! so a chevy Dmax LUV truck is worth almost 40,000USD or a ford explorer sport trac, basic model is like 48,000-55,000 USD...\n\nand they all have problems, sry to hear about the squeaking of your buddies ryde...\n\nbut ill take squeaking over burning coolant and oil any day",

        "lol. every car which is sold in the EU has to run on 95, and since there are no cars in massproduction with variable compression ratio, it doesn't matter what kind of fuel you use. even if u live in the us, most of the cars u can buy are aviable in the eu too. and\ufeff don't bother writing an educating answer, I know what I need to know on the topic.",
        "great\ufeff advert :L",
        "well, I don't know what kind of fuel you\ufeff have down there in Hungary, but here in Norway we fill our cars with 98...",
        "your choice, cool guys who don't know much about how\ufeff an engine actually works fill 98 here too, marketing over knowlege and business is goood:)",
        "well let's just get this straight: The higher the Octane level, the more resistant the fuel is for egnighting. That means the engine management\ufeff decides when the fuel is to egight, and the fuel won't go off spontaniously. THAT means the piston will be at the optimum position for ignition, which means you get better performance and fuel economy. This is backed up by science and practical experiments. Why do you think Koenigsegg themselves state that their CCR develops around 800HP on...",
        "... \"american\" petrol, where as it develops 850 on \"the more explosive jungle\ufeff juice we have here at home\" (as Clarkson so elegantly put it).",
        "octane number measuers the max ratio of compression that a fuel type can take before selfignite. it's a comprarsion to the mixture of ocatne and n-heptane. if a fuel has 95 octane number it is as compressible as a\ufeff mixture of 95 v/v% octane and 5 v/v% heptane.",
        "self ignition is avoidable in otto-cycle engines because it tumbles the spark ignited flame front thus causing a high frequency pressure fluctuation which destorys the laminal layer of gas in the cylinder causing increased heat transfer to the engine\ufeff block causing overheat and engine failure. compression ratio depends only on the geometrical properties of an engine, so engines cannot \"decide\" anything.",
        "you obviously know quite a lot about petrol, but you aparently don't know a lot about ECU's. The ECU in a (modern) car controls just about anything from cold start programs to indeed time of ignition. And if the petrol egnights before the time set\ufeff by the ECU, you get what's known as engine-knocking. Which we all know does wonders with an engine. Thank you and good bye.",
        "yeah ecu's are cool stuff, they set time for ignition and injection, multiple circles of pre- and postignition and pre-\ufeff and post injection. This is a good thing because with it u can optimize your engine charactersitics to rev and atchieve less emission (for example with pre-ignition longer combustion time=less CO, with post injection and fuel evaporation=cooler combustion chamber=less NOx). Some modern ecus even can contol valve opening times with electromagnetic control",
        "two things they cant control is\ufeff stroke lenght and piston diameter. these two things define the compression ratio and their value can be only set on the designers desk. No matter when you inject or ignite, the gas what is in the piston will be compressed to the same ratio",
        "So thats what\ufeff those rings stand for. To which company does the first key belong to?",
        "the first key is\ufeff from alfa romeo.  and nop the rings are the fusion of 4 companies.  horch audi wanderer and dkw.",

Top gear complained about the turn buttons and the nav being in the same screen as\ufeff the as the speedo. We, as car lovers, would also want to know the \"cons\" of the cars, even if the car is absolutely breathtaking.",

The blinkers on the wheel definitely take some getting used to, but it's not that big a deal either. The major cons of the car are simply price, ridiculous maintenance costs, limited storage space, and the very high odds of the car catching on fire. The radio is in there somewhere but I couldn't find it. Other than that, pretty damn good.",

        "if you care about a car being able to put down numbers, then you can probably build a race car yourself for much less money that will run good numbers. Ferrari's have a very \"complete\" feel to them, from the power delivery, transmission,\ufeff steering feel, suspension and balance. Combine that with exotic materials, exclusivity, rarity, and styling, and you really can't replicate all that. Plus, girls won't give a shit about your home built race car, but they will love your Ferrari.",

        "Got to agree with Matt. There is a big difference between a car thats designed from the ground up to handle 500+hp and building a car 200+hp car to make 500hp. Its never gonna feel the same, but building your own car is a great experience and sometimes its worth more than buying a supercar. \ufeff",

Just wanted you to know I became aware of TST through streetfire - I watched the (woeful, IMO) preview of the upcoming U.S. Top Gear, and  somebody commented that instead of having an \"Americanized\" Top Gear, they should just give you guys some production resources and flesh out TST.

Does the car apply the parking brake and melt the pads onto the rotor? I'm sure Ferrari thought about this, but it'd be interesting to find out more about this system.",

        "well it's got ceramics, so I don't\ufeff know if those have the same problems as regular steel rotors with setting the brake after the track, but if you plan on tracking any car, you should definitely take a few cool-down laps before you park it.",

That's my point. I'm not dissing how the car should be, it's how the car should run. Veyron is ugly compared to the McLaren GTR, but since it's faster... everybody forgives how ugly it is.",
        "which pony cars? even the slow ass RT challenger runs low 14s, last time I checked the rx8 was a 15 second car. \n\nthe new camaro runs a 13 flat and the new stang runs 12.7. the rx8 is a good car but\ufeff it cant hang with those three in the quarter but it should kill them on an autoX course.\n\ndifferent builds with different goals",

        "My opinion of the RX8 is the torque curve blows. It doesn't accelerate worth crap unless you get that engine spinning up unholy RPM numbers.Then, when you're hitting\ufeff that kind of RPM range, the point of a 1.3 flies out the window. It's a little impractical from both ends of the spectrum.",
        "What\ufeff is the name of that song at the beggining?",
        "well... it's actualy a 2.6, well been the case if it\ufeff were a piston engine\n. and the engine is basicly build for unholy RPM. u need to push the engine to 12-14k too damage it and good luck with that sins u can ''only'' push it to 10k without removeing the barrier. and this car is build for handling not for straigth lines,",
        "- Mazda markets it as a 1.3, and it even says so in the video so I'll go with 1.3 as the official displacement.\nI don't mind a car that's built for handling as long as it can do good in the straights as well. But, that's where the RX8 lacks. If you look at a brand new\ufeff RX8 vs a brand new V-6 mustang, you'll see that while the mazda might beat it slightly around the turns, the Mustang will easily pull ahead in the straights.",
        "yes because it's a 1.3 wankel, wankels work in a totally different way then normal piston engines. if a wankel engine got 1.3l it's the same as an 2.6l piston engine. also when rx-8 won all the ''car of the year'' prices it was put in the 2.5-3l engine catagory.\nwell depends todly on the track realy. if it's a track with many turns and not so many straigth lanes the rx-8 would win, but if it was a track\ufeff with only some turns and straigth lanes the mustang would have won.",
        "- Mustang has surprisingly tight handling that most don't give it credit for. It won't quite handle with cars like the Lotus Elise, but it does hold its own against RX8. Look at the G-pad ratings, and I may be mistaken but the Mustang might even have an advantage in late braking. I don't think the\ufeff RX8 could pull away just because of turns. In fact, turns may even be an advantage for the Mustang because it has a better torque curve and could come out of turns much faster.",
        "you might be right mate. anyway it's a fun car to drive atleast and I bet the mustang is also\ufeff great fun ^^",
        "- There is one thing I'd like to see in the Mustang, I'd like to see the\ufeff colored seat inserts. However, the Mustang has the interior where the gages can change to something like 128 colors. The 2011 Mustang V6 is also 300 HP which is how powerful the old 4.6 V8 was.\nYa, both the vehicles are probably fun to drive. I'm an American and prefer the styling of the Mustang.",

        "The Rx8 might not have as much power as cars like the mustang, but the power delivery does make it feel\ufeff like car with more hp than it actually has. It is light and torque is evenly distributed throughout the rpm range and so it pulls up to 7500 rpm. It really is fast and if you watch the rest of this episode of top gear you will see that it laid down the same time as an M3 on the test track.",
        "- What the RX-8 lacks is\ufeff torque. It doesn't accelerate the best off the line. It takes that engine spinning up very high RPMs to really accelerate out of the corners. The saving grace of the RX-8 is its light weight and solid handling. Otherwise, the thing would lay down the time of a VW New Beetle.",

Adding 1qt every 1.5k miles was annoying n if the engine would break down on me id have to look for a mech that works on rotary engines. Too much trouble for shit performance and bad mpg. I got an Evo now. just as shit quality but much much faster",
        "Well said! =)\ufeff",
        "U might wanna double check, the new Mustang GT gets over 30mpg of hwy now =)\ufeff",
        "I don't have to double check\ufeff anything. You would need to compare it to a 2010-11 Mustang not the 2013 model. 2011 was the last year the RX8 was made! Then the V6 Mustang only got 21mpg combined, and the V8 only got 19mpg.\n\nBy your standard the newest rotary engine with SkyActiv technology will most likely destroy the Mustang for fuel economy when its released this year!",
        "If adding 1qt of oil to a car once a month is annoying to you what are you doing with a sports car! I've driven a RX8 for a\ufeff year now and the warm up time is maybe 2 minutes, and that's for 9000rpm. Try revving your Evo to 9000rpm from a cold start!\n\nBTW, I only had to put 2k worth or parts in my RX8 to give it a power to weight ratio of a V8 mustang. (10.7lbs per 1hp) ... and it was rated as the best handling car under $100k a few years ago. I'm pretty sure that means its not \"shit performance\"!",
        "I got my\ufeff hands on a 2010 RX8 R3 edition with no miles on it. So far I absolutely love the the car, its got a few quirks, but nothing major. If you take good care of it and amazing handling is something you want in a car, you can't go wrong with a good condition RX8!",
        "Here comes a fan boy... I'm not going to argue since i'd just waste my time trying to reason with you. So here it goes. I'm sure your car is faster, I'm sure your car handles much better, I'm sure your car takes the wet roads better than mine, I'm sure it handles the snow better than mine, I'm sure it gets better mpg, I'm sure its roomier than mine, I'm sure\ufeff insurance is less than mine... I could go on forever but ill end it here with this \"THE RX-8 IS WAY BETTER THAN AN EVO\" Happy? Good =)",

You must talk to a lot of really immature people with how many assumptions you have!\n\nI can't stand when someone like you\ufeff comments on a car so negatively then names someone who called you on your bullshit a \"fan boy\"! With that I test drove a new EVO before buying my car and it was great, not as pleasurable for me as the RX8, but still a great car.",
        "My \"bullshit\" was saying that I didn't like all the trouble I had to go through to maintain the rx-8 and still get shitty performance... I'm not comparing it to your granny's Buick, I'm comparing it to sports cars and for the trouble there's way better cars. I'm glad you like your 8 though. Enjoy it. I'll continue saying the same thing since I OWNED both\ufeff cars and didn't just take it out for 5 min around the block.",

If you didn't like it that doesn't mean its a bad car, it just means you don't like putting a little oil in once in a while!",
        "I'm comparing the 8 to other new sports cars. What are you comparing it to? A 1983 Datsun 280? MY OPINION is that the 8's performance is not worth the \"special\" treatment seeing as you can get less needy cars with much better performance. I understand I upset you by calling your pride and joy a shit performance car, so let me apologize. That being said my opinion hasn't changed. If you're ok with treating a\ufeff 15 sec car like a 12 then go right ahead. Ill pass.",
        "Saying \"15 sec\" car right there says it all ... your a Fast & Furious Dragster wannabe.

I think the rx8 looks cool but its not in the same league as an Evolution. if you love the rotary engines trade your car for an rx7 then you can fight an Evolution and maybe win.",
        "Saying the Evolution is a better car than the RX8 is like saying the new GTR is a better car than a Porsche 911 Turbo because it can go faster around the N\u00fcrburgring. I have no problem with the Evolution, in fact I really like it,\ufeff but if you actually read the comments I have a problem with someone spewing a bunch of false facts about a great car because they happen not to like it!",
        "You'll notice I had nothing bad to say about the EVO, I like the Evolution, but you don't see it in Car and Drivers \"The Best-Handling Car in America for Less Than $100,000\" list. Just keep your false information about a great car that you happen not to\ufeff like to yourself.",
        "An opinion is not \"false\" information. You keep bringing up the handling as the savior for the 8, yeah the car handles nicely but do you really think you're going to outrun an EVO in the twisties? What about the fact that it has no torque? Gets incredibly bad mpg for a 1.3,\ufeff wait, it gets bad mpg period. So ill say it again the performance the 8 puts out isn't worth the special treatment it demands. At least in my opinion to be fair, but if you're ok doing that then go right ahead and enjoy it.",

        "Yep, with the few thousand I invested in upping the torque on my RX8 I have outrun a stock Evo on the track, keeping in mind that my car costs way less then a Evo. But at the same time I was outrun by a mildly modified one.\n\nIt's a\ufeff toss up, spend more money and get more speed, plain and simple.

        "I'm not going\ufeff to argue with you about the Evo because I can't win that argument. Out of the box the Evo is faster but you will pay a lot more money for the car, the RX8 on the other hand is bought for the experience not for the tech specs!\n\nA mid pipe, cold air intake, and AccessPORT cost a grand total of 1k and gained me 30+ ft. lbs... a seriously noticeable difference in the RX8 and did allow me to outrun a 09 Evo on a tight track.

Sometimes when I lock the car, one door (usually the driver's) doesn't lock and remains open unless I\ufeff unlock and lock again or lock it manually. Also, once the car locked itself while the engine was on and left me waiting outside. Have you had any of these issues?",

The only problems it has had that I remember was a worn angle gear (gear that helps\ufeff transfer power to the rear in awd volvos... it's too soft) and just lately the active magnetic suspension had issues, but it was a cracked pin on one of the connectors to the chassis computer, so that was cheap. I have a 2000 v70r and it's central locking is getting dodgy, but mostly from age. :)",

Guys like you are exactly what harley appeals to. The rest of us will enjoy passing your dumb ass and laughing our way down the road at you!",
        "I drive jacked up trucks because\ufeff I drive through 2 feet of snow all winter and work in a rock quarry, jack ass.  It's purpose, not looks I go for.  And I ride a Harley because I usually switch vehicles every 2 years so I'd like to NOT lose my ass on them when I want to sell them and move on to something else.  I can go all day on personal experiences with poor resale value of metrics, my best friend is the service manager at a can-am dealership.  talk about overpriced...",
        "Dude if you want\ufeff the answer to what people think, look at the video and compare \"likes\" to \"dislikes\" That pretty much tells it all. People are sick of the shit harley is producing. It's a bad joke from a mechanical perspective. Don't feed anybody this shit about trade in values. It's a load of bullshit. You will get a rude awakening when you get to trade in time I assure  you. I you want a bike you DON'T have to trade every couple years, get an import. Wake up dude, harley is junk",
        "nah, I'll stick with HD.  I sold my 1990 sportster in 2010, 20 years old, for $4700.  I doubt my 1985 Virago in the barn will see anywhere near $2000, and it's bobbed with a lot of other work done.  And it's not that I need to change vehicles, I just get tired with what I have and move on.  I'm on my 6th bike in 5 years and my 20-something car/truck, I'm 28 years old.\ufeff  I'm like a hoarder.  I buy a lot of vehicles, just without the keeping forever part lol.",
        "What is deceiving about how people perceive trade in values, is what a certain year bike/car brings at that particular time. What you have to do is look at what that vehicle cost new compared to the one you think lost it's\ufeff value. Subtract the difference and compare how much money was lost on both. For example. A new harley that sells for $17G in two years may bring $10Gs. While another bike that would cost $10Gs may only bring $6G. Which one held it's value better? Which lost more?",
        "my deuce was 16k new, its now 5 years old and books at 13,500.  lets see a metric hold that kind of\ufeff value.  A Harley that wont hold its value, a Vrod.  HD even lowered the msrp on them by almost 3k because of it, and it took less then a decade of that model being made to do it.  They price according to the market and buyer's wants, and none of their other bikes have dropped 3k in msrp.  So I guess the other bikes they sell are just what people in the market want.",
        "Wait til you try to trade it and see what you get. Sure is funny, when harley does make an attempt at a decent engine, the V-rod, it's rejected? Why\ufeff would anyone reject an engine with a decent power output FINALLY? What the hell is the matter with people",
        "I just went to kbb.com, looked up the resale on an 07' Duece and it said $9950.! \n Check it out. You lost over $6K on that thing! Funny thing is I compared import bikes of the same era, and found that they didn't\ufeff loose as much?! How can this be?? Research for yourself, you are sitting in front of the internet if you are typing on here! Be honest buddy, you will learn something.",
        "you looked up trade in.  Anyone with half\ufeff a brain knows you get raped on trading in anything.  I sell all my stuff outright, and usually for top dollar because I take care of and modify my vehicles.  Retail on my deuce, $13,500.  Not to mention it's a rare bike, so who knows how much better than retail it'll sell for if I ever do sell it.  As for the Vrod, extremely uncomfortable, and not worth $16000 for something an R1 will still spank.",
        "Look, Trade in is an average of what people get. If you think you\ufeff will get retail price good luck. Obviously if people take that low of price at trade in time, it can't be that great of a machine. You mentioned the Vrod being uncomfortable and slow, well that pretty much sums up the entire harley line up compared to the imports. Why would you want to ride the slowest, rattling machine made? When there are all sorts of cool and fun bikes to ride? open your eyes and mind.",
        "If you were to ride a Triumph Rocket, or Goldwing, you would understand what real power and decent handling\ufeff is all about. It's about going a distance, being able to outrun a car if need be, and being able to take a curve without dragging parts on the ground. Rather then looking or trying to look like a douche to fit into some sort of fairytail group of the supposedly badass biker image. I for one am tired of all that, it's boring, and cookie cutter. Nobody cares how much you spent.",
        "trade in is the average of what people get?  Are you mentally retarded??  seriously??  Trade in is on average only 70% of fair market value.  If dealers gave\ufeff people the \"average what people would get anyway,\"  they why in the hell would they do trade ins?  They'd never make any money off them!  Is it really that hard of a concept to understand?  Trade ins are ALWAYS lowball offers, weather its a Caddy, Jag, HD, Yamaha, or a damn pinto.  Dealers have to make money off them!",
        "A goldwing?  Seriously?  One of the heaviest bikes on the market with horrible gas mileage and looks like a tank???  I wouldn't be caught dead on one of those things.  I can ride my deuce all day with no problems, so it fits me just fine.  When I'm 65 years old, maybe I'll look into one, tho.  And talking about dragging parts on the ground in a discussion about harleys is just idiotic.\ufeff  It's a cruiser, they're not built to be able to easily drag a knee in the corners, numbnuts.",
        "I sold bikes so I know EXACTLY HOW IT WORKS. What the book calls \"trade in value\" is an average of what dealers give for that exact bike. I am not going to sit an argue a moot point. The way it is, is YOU paid way to much\ufeff for what you have for a machine. Take the name off and look at it for what it is. A motorcycle, barley a motorcycle. Hopelessly boring and lame, crude workmanship and the most ridiculous powerplant available in any brand. Try to grasp that fact.",
        "holy facepalm, dude, what part of I DON'T TRADE MY VEHICLES IN do you not understand?  What a dealer would give me for my bike does not make a damn bit of difference in what it's worth!  I don't give a fuck if trade in value is $10.  If fair market value is $13,500, then my bike is worth that on the market, numbnuts.  Point is, my bike is and always will be worth more than a metric if I ever do decide to sell it (NOT trade it in,\ufeff since you didn't get that the first 3 times)",
        "What you DON'T UNDERSTAND Is that you are full of shit. When you pay MORE up\ufeff front, it better be worth MORE at trade it. What you FAIL MISERABLY understanding is that you don't have as MUCH invested in other bikes, so they don't loose as MUCH! Does that make more sense? If you understood that, and the fact you get MORE bike for less MONEY. What part do we have to go over AGAIN?",
        "I think I see now why you USED to sell bikes, and do not currently.  Let's go back to the fact that 85% of HD's are priced the same FROM THE START as comparable metrics.  But, like I've said already, the metrics don't hold their value.  I've already had this discussion on another forum and done plenty of research to support my argument, so don't\ufeff waste your time telling me that HD's are twice the price of metrics new and blah blah blah.  They're not.  But still are worth more used.",
        "HAHAHAHA I couldn't have said\ufeff it better myself. Great video!",
        "FYI, I own an engine shop. They are NOT priced the same, not even close to similar imports. Again don't feed me the crap that they hold their value any better. I've had this discussion in person many times and proved it. Obviously harley advertising has set it's hook deep in your cheek to defend them as\ufeff you do. What truly makes anyone buy into that junk is expert marketing. Sold on a false image of a family and belonging, while at the same time wearing \"Made in China\"",
        "Where harley shoots you followers in the foot, is when they will finance anyone. So try and tell everybody how yours holds it value blah blah blah.... When anyone that can fill out a form, can buy one without hardly any interest rate. So why would ANYONE want a used one, when you can buy the new pile of junk with a tiny payment each month?\n Again, you miss the whole point. The engines harley use are\ufeff garbage compared to any other brand. I should know I work on the damn things.",
        "if you were a salesman and told me my HD is worth $4k less than market value because that's what any DEALER would offer me, I'd laugh at you, tell you you're an idiot, and then never return to your place of business.  BTW, 13 out of the 48 models of Yam, Suz and Kaw are under $11,000 new.  HD has 6 models that are\ufeff under $11k.  Are some HD's over priced?  Yeah, I'm not arguing that.  But 85% of HD's and metrics are similarly priced if you actually do some research.",
        "they'll finance anyone because, are you ready for this???  THEY ALWAYS GET THEIR MONEY BACK OUT OF THEM IF YOU DEFAULT ON THE LOAN AND THEY REPO IT!!!!!  My bank will NOT finance a motorcycle, new or used.  But I had\ufeff no problem getting financed for my deuce.  Hmmmm, weird how that works.  But since you know everything and say they're junk, I guess my bank is just not as educated on where to invest their money properly.",
        "I have read bullshit on the internet, but you almost take the cake. Do you NOT know that harley had to borrow $600 million from Warren Buffet because of all the people that defaulted on\ufeff loans? You had better go back to reading rather then writing on the Internet. If you were dumb enough to buy a Douche, there isn't much that can be said to help you understand you were ripped off. Mechanically you got the shaft for the money you spent. Compared to other bikes you were duped.",
        "I think every company in the US has had to borrow money in the last 10 years, it's not a new concept.  GM did, does that mean I won't buy a GM truck?  Nope.  Does every company get every single vehicle back that goes up for repo?  Nope.  That's just the way the world\ufeff works.  I guess if it ever does come time to sell my bike, I'm just gonna have to buy the most technologically advanced, fastest, most bad ass bang-for-the-buck bike in the universe according to you.  A goldwing.",
        "Don't confuse what I say and take things out of context. That is just saying you don't have an answer or anything to argue about, so you have to make shit up to have a comeback. \n I compared the Goldwing as a comparison.\ufeff It being heavy and a huge bike, yet so nimble and fast that it could outrun your douche without trying. I NEVER said it was the fastest or anything else you wrote. It is a good \"bang for the buck\" so is the Triumph Rocket III, and some of the Yamahas as well.",
        "And by the way, Not every company borrowed money. Gm used our taxpayer money to build plants in China. YOU WOULD SUPPORT A COMPANY THAT DOES THAT! I will support Ford, as they didn't borrow money and are staying ahead of the game building good vehicles, not trying to live off an old rep. like harley. Old news nothing to see here folks, just the\ufeff same tired old shit year after friggin year! Air cooled, Single throw crankshaft V-twin, shaking and rattling its way down the road. So Sad",
        "$24k for the cheapest goldwing is\ufeff the best bang for the buck????  and it runs a 1/4 in just under 13 seconds.  My bike is 250cc smaller and will run faster than that in 1/4 mile.  A stock sportster 1200 will run comparable to a goldwing that \"outrun my bike.\"  nice try.  And nimble?  it's like 200-something pounds heavier than my bike lmao.  Damn, you're dumb.",
        "You are so damn funny bud. You admitted what I was trying to get you to understand. A Goldwing is over 200 lbs heavier then your douche. 200 lbs!!! That's equivalent to having a large passenger on your bike! There should be NO\ufeff WAY that it could even be a close race, yet it's nearly identical. How long has harley been building bikes, yet they can't produce an engine that compares to others of its size? NHRA rules only allow half the cc to race against a harley. That says it all!",
        "what an idiot.ridin my 3rd Harley and never had problems other than tires. \ufeff",
        "how many 1949 hondas you\ufeff see rollin around? 0",
        "When goofballs like you understand what a decent engine is, you will laugh at what harley makes like\ufeff I and others do. Have you ever seen a harley crankshaft? You should because it's rather hilarious. One connecting rod comes out the side of the other. That would be like peddling a bicycle by placing one foot atop the other and peddling the bike from one side!   Think about that for a minute. What makes you guys like junk like that? Is it because you can't believe that it works? WOW",
        "You wouldn't see\ufeff ANY Hondas rollin around now if harley would have kept current with the times. What he showed in the above video is nothing better then what they had rolling back in 49'!\n Thank God for Honda, Suzukis and all the other imports, or we wouldn't have anything decent to ride at all!",
        "a goldwing has my engine beat by 4 cylinders and 250cc's, jack ass.  I should hope it's got a little more ass than mine!  Damn...  that's like comparing a\ufeff 6 cylinder s-10 to a v8 silverado and saying that just because the S-10 is lighter it should smoke the V8.  god, you're a dumbass.",
        "Your Douche should for sure be able to smoke a Goldwing, for as long as harley has been producing motorcycles, nothing should beat them in ANY category! I'd take a 600 and kick the crap out of your douche. How would you explain that? I once raced an S&S powered hardly with a Burgman 650 scooter and kicked it's ass! The guy got in my face yelling \"That isn't a motorcycle\" I\ufeff said \"I know, you just got your ass handed to you by a scooter\". My friend, you have a lot to learn.",
        "I like to tip over loud motorbikes when no one's looking.  The best places are at shopping\ufeff centers where they park up on the sidewalk.  I walk by and with a quick kick, there she goes!!!!!!",
        "People who destroy someones property for joy are the\ufeff lowest form of human.",
        "So get a Jap bike and you too can become\ufeff a superior, self righteous snob. Then you can put an Obama sticker on it and drive to the dufuss convention.",
        "Wow, you're totally right.  I bought my Deuce for the sole purpose of street racing, 1/4 mile runs, and for it's ability to rev to the moon.  I'm so disappointed now.  Go to any cruise night and find a rich kid with a hyabusa, then find an experienced rider on an R6.  Just\ufeff because it's expensive and should be faster, doesn't mean the driver knows how to drive it that way.  Damn, this is getting old.",
        "btw, anyone who has an HD with a built motor and gets totally pissed when they lose a race is most likely someone with too much money and not enough riding time.  The kind who just expect to win against everyone because they bought the best thing the internet said to buy to make them go fast, and have no respect for those who\ufeff may not have the most money in the world, but have better skills than they do.",
        "WOW, you are finally catching on a bit. I have been tryin to tell you that you could do all those things listed, with other brands. What your bike lacks IS the ability to keep up with the smaller bikes out there. Big or small your bikes gets wasted by them all! This video is the most accurate depiction of why so many of us now hate harley. If this is all they are going to produce, noise making vibrating shit boxes,\ufeff count us out! Not everybody has a need for attention, we just ride!",
        "Look, I have been trying to get you to understand that the video above is making fun of the technology that harley has\ufeff been giving us. It's yesteryear bullshit. Once you experience modern up to date technology, then ride a harley it's like driving a Model A Ford after driving Porsche. One has to wonder why you would choose the Model A ? Does this make sense? Especially when there isn't that much price difference so you say. We would rather have modern or NEW technologies.",
        "What really pisses MANY of us off, is the fact that harley can't produce a race bike if their lives depended on it. When they had the\ufeff chance, they threw it all away. Rather then give Eric Buell the resources to build an AMERICAN race bike, they treated him like shit. Made him use sportster engines which we all know are junk. Then FINALLY he had Rotax engines, won some races then they shut the program down rather then sell it to willing investors, and borrow money from Warren Buffet",
        "Many of us would love to see AMERICAN\ufeff sportbikes. Once harley has one, if they were smart, would use the technologies they learn from those and incorporate that technology into their cruiser bikes like OTHER COMPANIES DO!! But thanks to morons both in and outside the company that support their product, they most likely will never change. So get used to seeing more and more import bikes here! But then again, harley is building in India now so that makes them an import as well!!",
        "hey jackass, I DON'T WANT TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS I LISTED.  If I did, I'd have an R1 sitting in my garage, not a Harley.  I got over my\ufeff \"go as fast as possible\" stage when I was 24 years old, I have a daughter that depends on me to support her.  The speed limit is only 65 around me, and I could care less to ever see a track again.",
        "HD has been around twice as long as any jap manufacturer out there, and they're not going anywhere any time soon.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  And as for sporty engines, I've seen sportys for sale locally with over 60k miles on them, some with\ufeff over 100k.  You call not having 130 hp a junk engine, I call it dependability and what will get me to my destination without failing.",
        "Technology is more then going fast, it's being able to stop fast, handle better,\ufeff better lighting etc.... You confuse imports with having to go fast. The reason is, they do go fast with ease, unlike your douche. You put your life on antique technologies. You could care less about your daughter because if you did you would wear a full faced helmet, and full gear, and ride the safest motorcycles available. The harley is none of that my friend.",
        "Since harley has been around so long, then why in the hell do the make junk compared to other companies. They should have the best bike out there, yet the magazines rip them apart every test comparison. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? Give me a friggin break about puttin miles on harleys,\ufeff I can list several bikes that have more miles then that without anything but maintenance. 130 horse is pathetic, that is nearly what a 600 comes with stock you goofball. Grow up and open your mind!",
        "People like you are the ones who get their ass kicked by making comments like that in person.  I don't care about my daughter?  Go fuck\ufeff yourself.  I'm done with your stupid ass.",
        "Well bud you explain to the world why you reject better technologies which make bikes safer. I know damn well you don't wear a full faced helmet and gear, as it doesn't go with the \"LOOK\" of riding a harley. That is another whole discussion right there.\ufeff No you are trapped into a certain lifestyle which requires one to ride with a bandanna and a black leather vest in order to be \"Cool\". Technology makes riding better and safer. I feel sorry for your daughter!",
        "Oh, and now you wanna \"kick my ass\" because you can't defend your decision to ride a douche. You are typical. In person when\ufeff I have these discussions, I get the same reaction, because hey what can you say? It's junk you and I both know that, but you will defend it to the point of physical confrontation. You can't defend them in words because you deep down know that I am just being honest, and it the truth hurts! I hope you understand someday what you are missing!",
        "you could tell me whatever you want about my bike in person, and I would just laugh at you.  Tell me I don't care about my daughter, that's what\ufeff would get you your face caved in.",
        "Yeah you would REALLY be able to \"Cave my face in\". I don't have to tell anything about your bike that you haven't\ufeff already admitted. Poser",
        "I love it when someone says how long harley has been making bikes. How is it that other companies can produce a similar bike that out does a harley in every aspect? Read the mags bud, read the comparisons. Go test ride stuff at events. You are so misinformed that arguing with the likes of you is a lost cause. No matter what is put in front of you, you will disregard because it doesn't say \"harley\" on it. Their expert marketing has it's hook set in your cheek. You just can't see\ufeff it",

        "Nice!  I just rode with a guy Sunday who has a brand new Honda 750 shadow.  Went back to the same place he bought it from less than 30 days after he drove it off the lot, wanted the 1300.  They would only\ufeff offer im $5000 less than he paid for it new on trade!!!  Boy, that sure sounds like a jap company supporting its customer, eh?  HD ran a deal a few years back buy a sporty, ride a year, they give you retail for it on trade for a bigger bike.",
        "Why would you blame a \"JAP COMPANY\" for a DEALERSHIP decision. As a matter of fact and AMERICAN DEALERSHIP. They have nothing to do with the company itself you moron If you want to go deeper, you could blame the sales manager of that dealership. They probably have too many in stock, and with the\ufeff slow economy don't want them back. And your \"sporty\" comment is funny, try buying one now and trading IT back in and see what you get for it the next day. You are a thick headed individual",
        "You can defend those pieces of shit until hell freezes over, and you know as well as all of us that they are garbage. Just because you are embarrassed that you made the decision to ride one, doesn't mean you have to push that shit on anybody else. Others know better and are damn sick of uneducated people defending these hideous excuses for a motorcycle. When you have experienced other machines you would throw rocks at your douche. Look at the ratio of\ufeff likes to dislikes on video.",
        "Interestingly though the evolution of a biker always goes the same way. You drive different Jap bikes\ufeff for a while or even over a decade, then once you finally get over your prejudice and get that Harley you no longer want to drive anything else. Ever.\nOf all the countless bikers I've known that eventually evolved to Harley riders, less than 5% ever bought any other brand again.\nBut hey, if I have to explain you would not understand.\nHave fun whaterver you ride.",
        "5 years ago I'd agreed with you. You have one thing right, \"After you ride a harley you no longer want to drive anything else\" Because the experience sours people that badly. I'm not kidding here. I know many that finally made the final transition, and afterwards were so disgusted\ufeff with the machine after riding better, that they just sold them and quit riding all together. People aren't falling for the \"hype\" like the used to. Thanks to magazine articles and the internet.",
        "Another thing you wrote I find so hilarious is the statement \"If I have to explain you wouldn't understand\" That my friend is the biggest cop out statement\ufeff ever invented by harley loyalists. The reason you \"can't explain it\" is because there is no logic to it. It's a created hype through expert marketing. The bike is the final prop to belong to the harley family. They arent sold based on what you get for money spent, they are sold to\ufeff join a copycat group that needs to feel acceptance",
        "Get. A Life ! Why waste your time trying to piss anyone Off ! It's all about the Motorcycle Ride. If you enjoy riding who cares who rides what !

        "It would be great if it were that simple. You miss the point of the video. Many of us want more then what harley has to offer, ALOT MORE! I for one am tired of what they produce, which by the way is an embarrassment to\ufeff this great country. If someone wants to race, they have to ride an IMPORT! Because so many choose to ride to pose, and don't know better, harley will continue to make junk. I for one want to see harley produce bikes that compare to the rest of the worlds bikes.",

        "Not exactly. When other brands make way better bikes for the same or less money, it seem kinda strange that people would be proud to ride something that tells the rest of the world\ufeff we are motorcycle illiterate. \n You must not have watched the video above, then you would understand that many of us are tired that harley only produces noise making rattling piles of scrap. Please read the other comments so you understand a bit before writing asking a dumb question. It's not about hate.",
        "The other companies copy them as to gain a bit of the sales from that market group. What you have to understand is harley sold a bike based on being a\ufeff member to a group. Never does harley compare it's bikes to any other, because they can't. If they did, it would be all over for them. What is so damn funny is other companies can copy them, and get higher ratings in the test rides. The sound is brainwashed into people by expert marketing.

I don't talk shit about harleys, its the damn truth! They are antique junk, that is severely over-priced because they sold a lifestyle rather then make a bike to compare to all the others out there. You fell for it, that's fine, but don't expect others to settle for junk like that! It has nothing to do with being better then anyone else.",
        "Never have I said or implied that I was better because I ride a certain brand. It has nothing to do with ANY particular brand, other then harley producing garbage.\ufeff I'd like to think that we here in AMERICA are capable of producing motorcycles that the rest of the world could try to catch up to, rather then make cheap copies that are actually better then the original.

        "When I said \"fell for it\" I was referring to why you may defend harleys. For years harley has been selling a \"lifestyle\" \"joing the family\" and so forth. Nothing they\ufeff have been promoting is about the BIKE! Isn't that what riding is all about? The BIKE? Apparently not. At least for some.

Compared to other brands with modern technology.",
        "Inside the case is a crankshaft made to obtain a certain sound. Nothing to do with performance, or SMOOTH OPERATION. They rattle and shake themselves apart! Is this \"Cool\"? MANY of us are sick of the mentality that goes with it. The \"prestige\". If they really knew what they had compared to other brands, they would be embarrassed.

        "Lets break it down a bit. I am not knocking vintage. You take things completely the wrong way. You are correct\ufeff when you say harley engines are based off the radial aircraft engine. Only difference is they were balanced by having cylinders all the way around the \"Radial\". In harleys, you have a very unbalanced engine, with counterweights trying to make up for it. Don't confuse vintage with harley. It's a mockery of very well thought out engines.",

About 95% of what was said in the video is pure bullshit but they speak it like gospel truth. The only thing close to true was that Harley holds to traditional styling / retro look. It's a bike preference you fucking losers; now go outside, knock the dust off your ugly Honda and go ride some.",

Under there is a top mount inter cooler, the air passes over it cooling it much like the radiator of your NA car. However instead of coolant being  in the inter cooler it is simply air. Air that is then being forced into the same turbo that allows Subaru owners, like me, to smoke your sorry ass.",

        "A golf kart also doesn't weigh 3500 pounds.  207 lb-ft is nothing for a vehicle of that weight.

Correct about long trips, not possible as an only vehicle.  It's good for families with 2 cars (or those that can afford 2): 1 gas v. for long trips, 1 ev for daily commutes.  Most households have 2 vehicles.",
        "Powerplant equivalent to charge the car one time is still less emissions than 90 mi.of burning gas (and you have to factor in the power source:coal, nuclear, hydro,WIND, SOLAR?).Theoretically 0 emission if you have a solar powered residence with enough power to charge your home and the car.

        "if you do any research, you'll know that 1 full charge using electricity from a Coal plant is much less pollutant than 90mi of exhaust, even more so when charging over \"nonpeak\" hours.Also,coal provides ~%50 of US power source, so, that's assuming you get power from a coal plant.  By moving toward electric cars, we broaden our capabilities for alternatives to be \"greener\" which will make the progression toward a clean environment\ufeff a lot easier. gas only vehicles won't get much cleaner.",
        "The Volt is more practical for single car households, if either are in the first place.

I wonder what Beach House management will make of this apparent collaboration, as we Scots say A man with one blind eye and the other one stuffed with straw can see it is the same as Take Care as all Beach House fans will tell you.",

        "This a really great ad with a lovely sound track. I had a listen to the\ufeff Beach House track, and Holden, neither are the same. Take another listen 'reallitycheck', the lyrics and the tune is pretty different. The only similarity is the genre, but then it sounds like every other current Dream Pop /Synth Pop /Shoe Gaze song. There may of been inspiration taken when the track was composed but every artist is inspired by others, thats what's so great about music...",

        "That's actually pretty impressive given that this engine can be had for just $45,000 in the Challenger SRT8.  No European car can even come close to 470 hp for that price, and only Mercedes can offer the low-end torque offered by an American V8.  \n\nThe Aston Martin DB9 uses a 6.0L V12 making 470 hp.  Dodge can give you that same power and more torque for 1/5 the price and with 4 fewer cylinders.  The C63 AMG only makes 450 hp from a 6.3 liter V8 and costs\ufeff twice as much as the Dodge.",

I have problem with all car manufacturers that\ufeff makes huuuuge engines and the power output is not what it should be from cui like that. Yes benz and some other manufacturers still hang on to that '' big cui, costs less, easy hp '' idea, i just think its unprofessional, im not a eco guy haha =P but 8L v10 should produce more than 500 give or take HP =) Peace bro",
        "Normally, I agree. \ufeff However, when on a budget, the cheapest way to make more power is with more displacement.  It's hard to criticize a manufacturer like Chrysler when it is impossible to go faster for less.  As for the Viper, the latest iterations all made 600 hp.  It's still no 100 hp/liter Ferrari, but it will certainly give any Ferrari a run for its money!",

Nothing in its class handles or drives like a BMW 3 series, but to be fare its basically a sports car with sedan proportions so of course it will out handle anything in its class.

Better retail\ufeff value means proven better over all quality. truth hurts",
        "FYI i don't own or drive a LEXUS OR ACURA i was just stating a proven fact that LEXUS & ACURA though boring to look at and drive sometimes have a proven quality advantage over BMW, MB.

Besides that, they're fitted with the older 5-spd auto from Mercedes, but the newer AMG models are equipped with the 7-spd which give it taller over-drive ratios that help fuel\ufeff economy.

So, yes, I have experience with BMW's, and I can tell from experiance that DS5 makes even the E60 5 series feel a bit old and cheap inside. Not to even mention the 3 series which feels like 2 classes under DS5. Go drive the DS5 and see, instead of being ignorant and living in the past.",
        "Mat is always the best. Anybody willing to\ufeff review him?",
        "And in which way cant DS5 keep up against A4 for example? Its got a much better interior, higher build quality, better materials, better seats, better sound proofing, its nicer to drive, nicer too look at and nicer to spend time inside,  its more comfortable and drives just as good (Mats comments on steering are rubbish, since many other cars in class are no better), its got a better diesel, slicker gearbox, etc. Stop living in the past and instead of being an ignorant douche, go\ufeff test some cars.",
        "Can I add \"I wave them goodbye\"? I also appreciate original thought, but I am not prepared to go the step further and buy a car that sacrificed quality (effective, not appareances, which are good on the DS5) for\ufeff originality.",

New models from Citroen, Renault and Peugoet all got perfect reliablity marks since 2007 or 2008 up until now.

        "New cars often seem reliable. I did notice an apparent improvement on French cars (maybe more on Renault than PSA, but the latter was not as bad as the former), but some questionable choices make me sceptical. Most reliable cars are also rational, logicly developed and functional. Not sure cars like the DS5 or the 208 fit the bill. Maybe the 308 is a bit better. I consider reliable a car not showing its 10-15 years age, so today I'd look at R-reg to 52-reg cars. Time will tell for newer\ufeff cars.",

        "Is that based on that McLaren released vid where it got a head start on the 458 and a huge head start on the 997.2? At very high speed the MP4-12C would definitely pull away from a 997.2 T(S) with its 90+(60+)bhp advantage, but up to at least about 1/4 mile, it's all 997.2. Not to sound like I'm detracting from the\ufeff MP4-12C, if I had ~$250K to spend on a car it would be between the MP4-12C and GT2 RS.

Imo the mclaren design suits it well, as its mainly a great drivers car, but not much else. Where as Ferraris are always pushing the limits of style. the 458 is a true return to form for ferrari.

The R8 is definetly not a\ufeff \"REAL\" supercar its to refined to be one, and the ZR1 and GT2 are sports cars with supercar performace.",

        "what? the 458 has more driving aids than a GT-R, the gtr is like a robot, the 458 is a true\ufeff drivers car because its fun to drive, its mid engine, and rwd. and anyways you could turn all the aids off and the 458 is a much harder car to drive. as far as the 458 having more aids than the gtr, I don't think it does, i'm not really sure but the 458 isn't a dull boring awd coupe so i can't see why your bringing up the gtr which basically drives itself.",

The SRT's have been using suede instead of leather on the seat bottom and back. The other reason is alcantara is lighter than leather\ufeff which helps with reducing weight. Seats in most cars are quite heavy and when really trying to have weight reduction, everything possible area must be looked at. Alcantara is also flame resistant which they use in formula one seats.",

WOOOOOOW , you discovered the warm water :) That think of braking the inner or accelerating the outher wheel its anthic :) It first appears on tanks in 1940 :) and an older technology called limited slip diff does the same thing so whats the wow?:)",
        "Proper Engine ? I mean serious? Did u heared of no tom cruise rich people ? Did u heared about gas saving about normal engines about CO2 quantities.The gigantic 4L engines that uses 20L/100 km / now tell me how the hell you\ufeff suply it from a 200 minimum waige?That kind of monsters only sell in US cuz if u dont have one your not in line with fashion,you don't exist.People evolved from the ex-con tattoo full biker from 1920,they had families,the priority is not the CCM its the kids.",
        "Besides the subpower 5-6L,with only 4-500 HP ( full potential around 1300HP ) it just doesn't have what to do on a Sedan like Focus.Even a V6 wich is at least 3L would be way to much for this kind of car.2L is top of the range for it.As power,use a supercharger or turbo but dont multiply the CCM.Here is not like\ufeff UK were over a CO2 quantity the car fails MOT,but you pay for that.First reistring tax here for a 1968 6L Charger is $70 grand and anual tax 2700$.",
        "For any extra 200 CCM u pay 89$.Now explain it to me how the hell u pay for it when 620$ is a fat paycheck?How?All Europe genrally\ufeff need a 6-7-8L/100 km and so u don't struggle your brain,thats no less then 30mpg but if possible more then 40.Try that on any modern american car then cry.Thats why only successfull company in Europe its Ford,Opel and other ordinary car maker.So here proper engine is max 2L.If you a burnout fan,money burning car stand is a bit further.",

        "Calm down there sparky. I make about $200 a day so I'm not worried about paying a little extra to get what I want. I don't need a\ufeff giant 6.0 liter engine to have fun, but I won't pay for a watered down and poorly executed hybrid motor when there is no benefit in power or efficiency. Honda Civic Si for example 2.0 liter with 200 hp and gets the equivalent of over 30 mpg. Stop being such an arrogant pest and realize America doesn't have to worry about your shitty standards.",

The future of cars is in hydrogen power, because cars can stay the same as today, emit no emissions, and be as cheap as today. We just need\ufeff to invest into hydrogen-extracting facilities.",

        "- Yes, it has a disadvantage, but also has lots of advantages.  For example, DVD players were considered a step backwards by some because they couldn't record.  That didn't stop people from buying them for the better picture quality and no need to rewind.  So it all just depends on what a person's needs are.  I never drive more than about 40 miles per day, so the Leaf has worked great for me. \ufeff No more stopping to get gas.",
